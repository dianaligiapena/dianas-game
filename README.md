# Dancing Paws

Why Dancing Paws 🐈 :

It’s not unusual to find my laptop angrily typing only one letter while the cat comfortably sits on the keyboard.
So I thought – why not make a game and beat my cats at typing? 
Let’s see who keeps the seat when the music stops.

How you play Dancing Paws 🕹 :

The game consists of 5 rounds and 5 laptops to unlock. 
Each round you have to unlock one laptop by typing one password - you choose which laptop to unlock (or which password you will choose to type). 
You have time to do starting when the music begins to play and until it stops playing - and that is 5 seconds.
